groovim_sync
============

It's a shell script (works like a "daemon") that uses the applications "inotify-tools" and "unison" for synchronizing directories via network using samba or compatible networking protocol. It's ideal for software development using virtualized environments (VMWare, VirtualBox...), enabling real-time manipulate files from your guest synchronizing them with local directory on your host. It's perfect for keeping local repositories on your host from multiple development environments and ease of use with repository technologies like Git, SVN and others doing everything in a unified way! Using it in conjunction with the GrooVim (Vim mod) to form a practical and powerful development environment for multiple platforms.
